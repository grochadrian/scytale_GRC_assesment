Governance, Risk, Compliance Information gathering
-------------------------------------------------------

SecureAI solutions:
	- Saas company (Software as a Service) - Clients will access our software hosted on our servers through a pay-as-you-go OR lease arrangement
	- Most if not ALL information will be processed on our own servers so heavy responsibility to ensure its safety
	- Analyze real-time transaction data for BANKS and FINTECH companies to identify suspicious activity (Heavy emphasis on personal information)
	- Region: US & Europe (Different laws and regulations for different regions. Data Sovereignty Laws - NB in Europe!)
	- NO formal compliance certifications (No external, official, audited certification processes like SOC 2, ISO etc.)
	- Clients asking for assurance frameworks (Proof/evidence of proper security and compliance controls. Through vendor risk assessments, RoE, Legal Agreements etc.)

Data Types:
	- Regulated Data (Information that has storage and handling compliance requirements defined by national and state legislation and/or industry regulations.)
	- Financial Data (Data held about bank and investment accounts, plus information such as payroll and tax returns. Also encompasses details of financial transactions.
			  Highly sensitive and confidential.)
	- Human-Readable & Non-Human-Readable Data (As it says. Need to consider both when implementing internal security controls)
	
Standards(NB):
	- Expected outcome or state of a task that has been performed in accordance with policies and procedures. Standards can be determined internally, or measured against 		
	  external frameworks.
	- Regulatory requirements are the primary driver for adopting standards (GDPR, HIPAA etc.)
	- We want Industry Standards aimed at regulated, financial data compliance.
	- Lots of region specific standards that could be important down the line. Maybe 2 roadmaps once company large enough?
	
	Examples:
	ISO/IEC 27001 — An international standard that provides an information security management system (ISMS) framework to ensure adequate and proportionate security controls 
		        are in place.
    	ISO/IEC 27002 — This is a companion standard to ISO 27001 and provides detailed guidance on specific controls to include in an ISMS.
    	ISO/IEC 27017 —An extension to ISO 27001 and specific to cloud services.
    	ISO/IEC 27018 —Another addition to ISO 27001, and specific to protecting personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds.
    	NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Special Publication 800-63 — A US government standard for digital identity guidelines, including password and access 
    											   control requirements.
    	PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) — A standard for organizations that handle credit cards from major card providers, including requirements for 
    								 protecting cardholder data.
    	FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) — FIPS are standards and guidelines developed by NIST for federal computer systems in the United States that specify 	 
    							  requirements for cryptography.

Legal Environment(NB):
	- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Provisions and requirements protecting the personal data of European Union (EU) citizens. Transfers of personal data outside 		
						     the EU Single Market are restricted unless protected by like-for-like regulations, such as the US's Privacy Shield 
						     requirements.
						     
	- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):  Provides California residents rights to know what personal information businesses collect, access it, delete it, and opt out of
						   its sale. Applies to organizations serving California residents that meet revenue/data thresholds ($25M+ revenue, 50000+ 
						   consumers/devices data, or 50%+ revenue from selling data). Less comprehensive than GDPR but important for US operations. 
						   
	- EU AI Act (NEW!): Risk-based regulatory framework for AI systems operating in the EU (phased enforcement 2025-2027). Uses four tier risk model with AI systems used in 
			    credit scoring, fraud detection, and AML(Anti money laundering) compliance classified as "high-risk" requiring conformity assessments, risk management, 		
			    data governance, transparency, human oversight, and accuracy or robustness testing. Directly impacts AI powered fraud detection products.
